Breakdown of the Playbook:
Installs a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) along with WordPress and necessary PHP modules.
Secures MySQL by creating a WordPress-specific database and user with defined credentials.
Downloads and configures WordPress, using the serverâ€™s IP or temporary URL ({{ wp_url }}).
Enables heavy plugins like WP Super Cache (but with misconfigurations), All in One SEO Pack, and WP Cron Control, which are known to generate high load when not managed correctly.
Misconfigures PHP settings by lowering the memory limit and max execution time, making it easier for PHP scripts to hit their limits.
Disables Apache caching, leading to repeated loading of assets from disk rather than from cache, which adds I/O load.
Simulates high traffic using Apache Bench (ab), which sends 10,000 requests with 100 concurrent connections to simulate heavy traffic load.

How to Fix the Issues:
Optimize Apache Configuration:
Re-enable server-side caching (e.g., mod_cache or mod_expires) to reduce load on Apache by serving cached assets.
Increase MaxClients (or equivalent in Apache 2.4: MaxConnectionsPerChild) to handle more concurrent connections.
Optimize PHP Settings:

Increase memory limits in /etc/php.ini:
memory_limit = 256M


Increase execution time for scripts:
max_execution_time = 60



Implement Database Caching:
Install and configure caching plugins like WP Super Cache properly. Ensure disk-based caching is working and caching rules are optimized.
Use object caching via a plugin or Redis/Memcached for database query caching.
Disable Unnecessary Plugins:
Disable or remove any resource-intensive or poorly optimized plugins (e.g., WP Cron Control) if they are not necessary.
Use a tool like Query Monitor to identify slow plugins or themes causing high resource usage.
Enable Compression and Minification:
Enable GZIP compression in Apache to reduce the amount of data transferred between the server and client.
Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files using a plugin like Autoptimize.
Optimize Database:
Run database optimization commands, or install a plugin like WP-Optimize to reduce the overhead in the MySQL database.
Set up MySQL query caching or tune the database configuration (/etc/my.cnf) to allow for more concurrent queries.
Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):
Offload static assets (images, JavaScript, CSS) to a CDN to reduce server load and bandwidth usage.
Scale Resources:
If using a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean), consider scaling the server vertically (add more CPU, RAM) or horizontally (add more servers).
Set up load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers.
Monitoring and Tools:
Use top or htop to monitor CPU and memory usage in real-time.
iostat or iotop for monitoring disk I/O.
mysqladmin status for monitoring MySQL load and slow queries.
Apache Benchmark (ab) or Siege to stress test the site and see how it performs under load.


This playbook installs a WordPress site, deliberately misconfigures the environment, and stresses the server to simulate high load and slow performance, allowing agents to diagnose and fix the issues based on best practices.
